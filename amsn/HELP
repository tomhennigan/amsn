Help file for amsn

Requirements:
Amsn is written in tcl/tk, so you just need a working tcl/tk interpreter,
version 8.3 or later. You can get it at http://tcl.sourceforge.net. The
interpreter is available for linux, windows and macintosh.Some additional
features might require extra programs, or libraries, like the docking icon,
the Display Pictures, or the SSL connection for MSN Protocol 9.

Installation guide:
Download the amsn-x_xx.tar.gz file. Untar it with the command:
  gzip -d amsn-x_xx.tar.gz
  tar xvf amsn-x_xx.tar
It will create a msn/ directory, and amsn is installed and ready to run.
To launch it, do:
  cd msn
  ./amsn
or if this doesn't work, try
  wish amsn
If wish command doesn't exist, then you don't have tcl/tk correctly installed.
If "wish amsn" works, but "./amsn" doesn't, edit 'amsn' file and set the
correct path to 'wish' in the first line. By default it's set to:
/usr/bin/wish
