<p>aMSN is written in Tcl/Tk, an interpreted language, so the "amsn" file is just a text file with the program code. The file manager might
think it's a text file, so it will launch the text editor.

</p><p>If aMSN still hangs, and you are using a 2.6.x kernel, try running aMSN with: 
</p>
<pre>  export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 &amp;&amp; amsn

<p>This command will tell the dynamic linker to use the old thread model.

<p>In this case, the firewall may be blocking incoming connections. File transfers work this way: When you want to send someone a file, you send an invitation with your IP address and a port number. Then the remote client must connect to your IP:port to start the transfer.
</p><p>The used port is usually 6891, 6892 and so on (first transfer is on port 6891,but if you start a new file transfer while the first one hasn't finished yet, then it will use 6892, and so on).
</p><p>If you are using a firewall, you must make sure that it allows incoming connections to port 6891 (and next ones if you want to be able to make more than one transfer at the same time).
</p><p>If you are behind a router, enable port forwarding for ports 6891 to 6900 to your PC's internal IP address.
</p><p>You can change the port value from the "Connection" tab of the Preferences window.

<p>Users with MSN7 and later versions of MSN will automatically "open a conversation window" with you as soon as you (or they) connect. It is done automatically because they try to download your display picture. So, as soon as someone connects, the screen was flooded with windows from people just trying to download the display picture. This was annoying, so the feature was removed.
</p><p>Note also that since Windows Live Messenger 8.0, the user would not join the chat until he sends the first message, so this is a second reason why it is not possible anymore.

<p>First of all, it may be a font problem: try making aMSN run with a different font (under Account -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Appearance). 
</p><p>Second, you may need to run aMSN using a different encoding (under Account -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Appearance again, utf-8 is a safe choice). 
</p><p>Third, try clearing your font cache with the command: 
</p>
<pre>  fc-cache -fv
</pre>
<p>Then, make sure your locale (your LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE environment variable) is installed on your system: 
</p>
<pre>  set | grep LC_ 
</pre>
<p>and make sure the corresponding directories (after the = ) exist on /usr/lib/locale . If they don't, install them according to your distribution. 
</p><p>Finally, if none of the above works, try disabling some FontPath's from /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/Xorg.conf until you find out which font path contains problematic fonts, and recreate the fonts.cache , fonts.dir and fonts.scale in that directory.

<p>Yes. To have nicknames displayed in their full length on the contact list, in the alerts and the chat window, go to 'Tools' &rarr; 'Preferences' &rarr; 'Advanced Tab', and uncheck the selection which reads, Truncate nicknames longer than window width in window titles and contact list.” (Screenshot 5.7)

<p>This problem is not coming from aMSN, it's an Xorg faulty installation. You probably have a bad Xorg configuration for the file rgb.txt (especially with some versions of Xgl).
</p><p>If you are using xgl, you most probably have the file rgb.txt in /etc/X11 . Xgl in Ubuntu Dapper is usually misconfigured and looks for the file in /usr/share/X11 . Make a symlink to it in /usr/share/X11 and restart your X server.
</p><p>If you are not using xgl, open your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for a line that says:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<pre>  Section "Files"
       RgbPath      "/etc/X11/rgb"
</pre>
<p><br />
If the RgbPath line does not exist at all, add it under the section "Files". Then make sure the file exists in the directory defined in RgbPath (/etc/X11/ in this case). You may need to copy it from another location in your computer, or you can download it from <a href="http://amsn.sourceforge.net/rgb.txt" class="external free" title="http://amsn.sourceforge.net/rgb.txt" rel="nofollow">http://amsn.sourceforge.net/rgb.txt</a> . You must also restart your X server for the changes to take effect. PLEASE NOTE: the line in xorg.conf must NOT contain the extension of the file!!!

<p>aMSN cannot handle files containing the character `(back quote) in their path. A way to resolve this issue is to mount the partition containing the file with this caracter with the 'utf8' option. Refer to the man page of your version of <i>mount</i> to find the right option for your file system.
