=== Version Alvaro's Messenger==========================

The CCMSN was great but unfortunately its original author
abandoned the project. Although it was very functional it
still needed major work to improve its look and feel
as well as complete the protocol support among many 
other things. That's when we, originally two working on
it separately, decided to join efforts and bring to you
this fine (we hope) piece of work ;)

========================================================
=== Important note, read this =================

Some people have been noticing frequent hangs when using
amsn. This is due to a wrong configuration of the sound
command. By default, the sound player command is 'esdplay'
(the Gnome sound daemon). If you aren't using esd, go to
preferences -> sound and change the command to 'play' or
anyone you like.

Compu's Messenger - http://messenger.CompuCreations.com/
========================================================
=== short note === version 0.3p3 - 20010926 ============

Hej, this is still a relatively new project, so do not
expect everything to work! :)

BUT if anything doesn't work, and why not, even if it
does, I'd be happy to hear from you - just drop me a
line on:

   dave@CompuCreations.com

========================================================
=== About ==============================================

Compu's Messenger is a multi-platform MSN Messenger
(though it works best on unix platform). It has support
for getting the user list from the server, block lists,
chats with more than two users, emotional icons, HTTP
proxy and logging facility.

Still lacks:
   o font/colour in chats
   o file transfers

========================================================
=== How to =============================================

   o TO ADD A CONTACT, go to CCMSN menu, and select
     "Add a Contact" from the menu. No error reporting
     so far, so if the user does not show up in the
     contact list, then there must have been an error
     adding the user

   o TO DELETE A CONTACT, just right click on his/her
     display name, and select delete

   o TO CHAT A USER, select the user from the "Message"
     menu, or right click and select "Instant Message"

     One have to wait for the other user to join before
     being able to chat. A message saying:
      "User display name (email@address.dom) joins chat"
     informs you when someone else has just joined the
     chat.

     To have a multi-party chat, just select the user
     you would like to join from the invite menu.

     Emotions are supported, so typing ":)" and the rest
     will show a graphic.

   o TO CHANGE YOUR ONLINE STATUS, select the status
     from the "My Status" sub-menu in the CCMSN menu.

   o TO BLOCK A USER from seeing your online status,
     right click and select "Block". Likewise to unblock

   o TO CHANGE YOUR DISPLAY NAME, just select
     "Change Display Name" from the CCMSN menu.

   o TO CONFIGURE PROXY SERVER, make sure you are
     disconnected, and select "Proxy settings" from the
     CCMSN menu.

   o TO SWITCH ON LOGGING, edit ~/.ccmsn/config and
     append a line "keep_logs 1"

========================================================
=== Note on Logging ====================================

logging should be retought a bit! main problem is
deciding how to keep logs of chats with multiple users
joining/leaving. Currently keeps msgs based on users in
chat. i.e. if chatting to userx, it will be logged in
file userx. If chatting to userx and usery, it will be
kept in a file userx-usery. This causes a chat session
to be split over multiple files if users are joining/
leaving during the chat!

========================================================
=== Please send any feedback ===========================

Just do not hesitate to send me any comments :))
