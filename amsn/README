=== Alvaro's Messenger==================================

CCMSN was great but unfortunately its original author
abandoned the project. Although it was very functional it
still needed major work to improve its look and feel
as well as complete the protocol support among many 
other things. That's when we, originally two working on
it separately, decided to join efforts and bring to you
this fine (we hope) piece of work ;)
