20010924 compu	o basic logging facility (edit ~/.ccmsn/config and append a
		  line "keep_logs 1") - logging should be retought a bit!
		  main problem is deciding how to keep logs of chats with
		  multiple users joining/leaving. Currently keeps msgs based
		  on users in chat. i.e. if chatting to userx, it will be
		  logged in file userx. If chatting to userx and usery, it
		  will be kept in a file userx-usery. This causes a chat
		  session to be split over multiple files if users are
		  joining/leaving during the chat!
