20010924 compu	o config file support - unix uses "~/.ccmsn" directory, other
		  platforms use "running directory/ccmsn" directory
		  currently file keeps Sign-in name and proxy by default.
		  - also used for logs, see below
20010924 compu	o save password option - stores password in plain text in
		  config file - no problem in unix as file/directory are
		  only readable by user
20010924 compu	o basic logging facility (edit ~/.ccmsn/config and append a
		  line "keep_logs 1") - logging should be retought a bit!
		  main problem is deciding how to keep logs of chats with
		  multiple users joining/leaving. Currently keeps msgs based
		  on users in chat. i.e. if chatting to userx, it will be
		  logged in file userx. If chatting to userx and usery, it
		  will be kept in a file userx-usery. This causes a chat
		  session to be split over multiple files if users are
		  joining/leaving during the chat!
