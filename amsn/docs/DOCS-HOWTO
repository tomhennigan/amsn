This little document is a guide to translators and translation
managers that works or wants to work in aMSN. It is indeed a
little document, but has a lot of information. We suggest you 
to print it and leave it within the reach of your hands if you
are serious in this translation business.

First things first: there are TWO documents you must read.
This is the DOCS-HOWTO, that explains what you have to do
when you waht to translate the FAQ, README and HELP files of 
you 

There is *another* document called LANG-HOWTO, that is in 
msn/lang/LANG-HOWTO, that deals with the translation of the 
messages, those that are shown on aMSN's menus, dialog boxes 
and windows. We call those files "language files" or, in short,
"langfiles". 

YOU SHOULD READ BOTH DOCUMENTS, the DOCS-HOWTO *and* the LANG-HOWTO,
but choose one first, read it, understand it and, only then, read the other.

Another word of warning: if you are in doubt, please ask! 
We will be pleased to help you. The right place to ask 
questions is our discussion list: amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net
You must subscribe to post there. Instructions on how to subscribe
can be found here: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/amsn-lang

One of our goals is to be the most internationalized 
free software / open source project of the world. 
And for that we need you!

Thanks for the interest on the aMSN project!

============
Introduction
============

There are many ways you can help the aMSN project. One of them is 
by translating the software to other languages. This can be easily
done. Another way is proofreading the current translations in search
of typos and errors and missing (untranslated) messages. There is
plenty of work for everyone who wants to be involved, and this seems
to be your case as you are reading this file ;-)

If you open you aMSN main window, you will notice that there is a 
"Help" menu. This menu has seven entries. There is a "Help" section, 
a FAQ section and an "About" section in english. Also, we have the same
scheme - a "Help" section, a FAQ section and an "About" section - in 
your own language. At the bottom we have a "version" item.

In order for you to have the FAQ, About and Help sections translated to 
your own language, there must be exist the corresponding FAQ, README and
HELP files for your language.

The Help menu of aMSN Messenger can be translated into any language you want. 
It is easy to do so because all of the translated texts for every 
new language are stored in special files:

FAQxx	  - The translated FAQ file
READMExx  - The translated README file
HELPxx	  - The translated HELP file

The name of these indicates clearly the language it contains. 
The format is FAQxx, READMExx and HELPxx, where "xx" is the 
two-caracter ISO code of your language. For instance, for the 
italian language, whose ISO code is IT, the files are called

   FAQit
   READMEit
   HELPit

A few examples:

Valenciano: FAQva, READMEva, HELPva
Spanish: FAQes, READMEes, HELPes
German: FAQde, READMEde, HELPde
French: FAQfr, READMEfr, HELPfr

The ISO codes for the valenciano, spanish, german and french languages are, 
respectively, va, es, de and fr. Later in this document we will see how
to determine the country code for new languages.

All translated FAQxx, READMExx and HELPxx files (which we call "documents") are 
stored in the msn/docs folder of your aMSN installation. The exception are
the english files, that have no country code (FAQ, README and HELP) and reside
on the main msn folder for legacy reasons. For the languages already
present in aMSN (some completely translated, some not) look in the msn/docs
folder and look for the apropriate files reflecting your language.

Unfotunately, we don't have these files integrated with our website, the way
the so-called "langfiles" are (refer to the msn/lang/LANG-HOWTO document and our
translation website: http://amsn.sourceforge.net/modules.php?name=Translation). 
We are studying ways to intregrate the FAQ, HELP and README files in the automated
translation scripts we hav on the Internet - bu there is nothing practical right now.
You should check periodically the lateststable version of aMSN (or the CVS version
if you have this access) and compare the latest english FAQ, README and HELP files
to you langiage's (possibly outdated) FAQxx, READMExx and HELPxx files 
Yeah, I know. Hard work, difficult to understand.
Nothing we can do right now, sorry.

Even if your HELPxx, FAQxx and READMExx files are the same version as the master 
(english) ones, you still have work to do in them. It is important to proofread the
files, scanning them for possible typos, gramatical errors or bad writting styles 
introduced by other translators.

This document (msn/docs/DOCS-HOWTO) deals ONLY with the HELP, FAQ and README files. 
Please read the present document completely, make sure you understand everything 
and ask what to do (at amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net) when in doubt.

There are other files that need translation and proofreading like the
langXX files (that is, the language files that translates aMSN's messages, 
menus and dialog boxes). There is another document called LANG-HOWTO,
located at msn/lang/LANG-HOWTO. *PLEASE READ THAT DOCUMENT TOO*


Tip: this DOCS-HOWTO file surely contains many errors. If you are a
native english speaker, please help us by proofreading it.


===========================
0. The most important thing
===========================

You MUST subscribe to the amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net mailing
list. There you can discuss various issues with the members of the
translation team, including:
- The best way to translate a word or phrase;
- What character code you should use or not use;
- Best translation practices;
- Issues and questions about this HOWTO;
- Coordination of local efforts;
- Stablishment of local language translation managers.

One important thing you MUST ask at the amsn-lang list is if there
is somebody already doing what you intend to. 

For instance, if you want to translate the FAQ file into greek
(FAQel) you shoud ask first. This way, if there is another person
already translating the same FAQel you won't waste your time.

You can subscribe to the list by visiting this page:

   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/amsn-lang

Remember, joining or not is not an option. You MUST subscribe.

==================
1. For Translators
==================

When you translate the FAQ, README or HELP files, you should send the 
entire updated FAQxx, HELPxx or READMExx file to the translator managers, 
who can be reached at

    amsn-translations@lists.sourceforge.net

Diff files are also accepted, and can be used in certain cases where
you update more than one file with a single diff or you merge
different files into one, but the best and easyest way (for both
translators and managers) is to send the whole translated file. If
in doubt, send the entire file.

You must send a text file attached to your email message. Translations sent 
in the body of the email will be ignored, due to character coding and 
line break issues.

You can help us by translating some sentences to your language,
or modifying wrongly translated sentences (proofreading).

RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED:
----------------------------

FIRST OF ALL:
   STAY TUNED ON THE amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net LIST!!!
   Developers will always announce there the availability of new versions of
   the english FAQ,README and HELP files!!! This will be your starting gun!

When a new version of the file is announced, follow these steps:

0. Make sure you are looking at the right file.
Translated FAQs are in the msn/DOCS folder.
Also make sure you read and understand the translation instructions 
at msn/docs/DOCS-HOWTO. By the way, it's the present document.

1. You will have always to download two files: the most updated english
file and the most updated file in your language. For this example, we will use 
the FAQ file and the language-couple egnlish/german. But it works the same way
for the other two files (README, HELP) and the other 50 languages.

If you want to translate (or update) the FAQde file (german FAQ file) 
you must download both

   FAQ   and
   FAQde

from our SourceForge's CVS. There is no other way to dowload these up-to-date files.
We are working on it (to make download of latest FAQ, README and HELP files easyer) 
but now it is just the way it is.

To download from CVS, visit this page and follow intructions:

    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=54091

Please read the CVS instructions thoroughly and carefully!
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

-NEVER use files from a stable AMSN package, as they are probably out
of date, and you'll find yourself translating things that are
already translated in the latest file version.
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

2. Open both FAQ and FAQde, each one in a window, side by side on 
your screen. Close all other windows but this two. It is important to have 
both documents open at the same time so you can scroll both of them down and
compare both versions. In a graphic environment (Mac OS, Windows, KDE, Gnome)
there would be no hassles. If you insist in doing everything in text mode, 
use the "screen" command (for further information, "man screen").
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

3. Compare the version of the latest FAQ file with the latest FAQde file. 
If versions are the same, go to step 4. If versions differ, hunt down the 
differences between FAQ and FAQde and translate the missing segments.
The diff tool is your friend (man diff --- se section 3 of this document).
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

4. Do NOT close windows! Proofread the FAQde file in search of errors. 
Compare it again with the english FAQ file. If (*AND ONLY IF*) you are 
sure that there are no errors, update de version of the file, making it 
the same as the original english file.
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

5. When all errors are fixed, send the updated file to
amsn-translations@lists.sourceforge.net
-We will ONLY accept FAQxx, READMExx and HELPxx files. We will NOT accept, 
in ANY way, individual sentences or paragraphs in the body of the email. 
You MUST send the COMPLETE file (for instance, READMEit if you are italian)
ATTACHED to de email message. Only in special cases we will accept
diff files or incomplete files with a few sentences.
-As stated above, anything sent in the body of the email will be
IGNORED and DISCARDED.
-Files sent to other email addresses than
amsn-translations@lists.sourceforge.net will also be IGNORED and
DISCARDED. When in doubt, ask!

Including the text directly in the email body
is a bad idea, as mail clients usually split long lines and
change the character encodings, which leads to mistakes.

OTHER KINDS OF CONTRIBUTION WILL BE REJECTED, IN ORDER TO MAKE THE
JOB EASIER TO THE MANAGER.

I hope you understand, there's usually one person in charge of
updating the translations, and there are more than 50 languages, so
there are many translations and submission. Don't make it more
difficult :)

When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

HOW TO ADD A NEW LANGUAGE
-------------------------

0. Make sure you are looking at the right file.
Translated FAQs are in the msn/DOCS folder.
Also make sure you read and understand the translation instructions 
at msn/docs/DOCS-HOWTO. By the way, it's the present document.

1. Choose a short identifier for your language (for example danish
- da). It is better that you use the correct ISO code for your
language. ISO codes for languages can be found at

    http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm

Always use the 2-letter code for your language if it exists (for
instance, fr for french, pt for portuguese). If your language has
only a 3-letter code (for instance, ale for aleut, pap for
papiamento) you must use it, though. 
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

For languages spoken on colonial lands, you shoud use the language
ISO code followed by an underline and the country ISO code in CAPS
(fr_CA for canadian french, pt_BR for brazilian portuguese). 

Language ISO codes:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm

Country ISO codes:
    http://www.bcpl.net/~jspath/isocodes.html

Some codes have been mistakenly taken (for example, langbr once was 
taken for the brazilian portuguese, but the correct code would be
pt_BR, br alone refers to the breton language). If you find that
the ISO code for your language has been taken by mistake for
another language, scream your lungs out at the amsn-lang list and
we will fix things up ;-)
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

2. Download the english version of the file you want to creates.
You should always download the most updated english file available. 
For this example, we will use the FAQ file and the language-couple 
egnlish/german. But it works the same way for the other two files 
(README, HELP) and the other 50 languages.

If you want to create a new FAQde file (german FAQ file) 
you must download the most up-to-fate english FAQ file 
from our SourceForge's CVS. There is no other way to dowload 
this up-to-date file. We are working on it (to make download of 
latest FAQ, README and HELP files easyer) but now it is just the way it is.

To download from CVS, visit this page and follow intructions:

    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=54091

Please read the CVS instructions thoroughly and carefully!
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

-NEVER use files from a stable AMSN package, as they are probably out
of date, and you'll find yourself translating things that are
already translated in the latest file version.
When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

3. Copy the file msn/FAQ (the one you just downloades) to msn/DOCS/FAQde
Note that the english FAQ/README/HELP files are in the msn folder, not 
the msn/DOCS folder. Remember that, for some languages, the ISO code has three
(3) letters.

4. Translate the whole file as described in the RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED
subsection (earlier in this document --- two windows side by side etc).

5. PROOFREAD YOR FILE, or better, ask someone else to do it. If you don't
know anyone who can do it, try the amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list. 
They will help.

Also TEST your file in your own aMSN messenger. Go to the Help menu and see if
you text fits, if there's no error opening the file, if aMSN freezes, if character
coding is correct etc.

6. Only after testing for one or two days, send the new file to

    amsn-translations@lists.sourceforge.net

Send to this email only! Submissions to other emails will be ignored
and discarded.

7. Of course, the file will have errors. So please ask again to the 
kind folks at amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net to proofread the file.

8. When in doubt, ask! (amsn-lang@lists.sourceforge.net)

===========================
2. For Translation Managers
===========================

This is not quite different from what you read in the LANG-HOWTO file.

When a new FAQxx, READMExx or HELPxx translation arrives to you, you should 
only accept it if is a diff file or a complete FAQxx, READMExx or HELPxx file. 
Do not accept other kinds of submissions, 'cause our users have the sad habit 
of sending sparse translated sentences by mail, and it's impossible to do
anything useful with them :)

*YOU, AS A TRANSLATION MANAGER, ***MUST*** READ THE NEW FILE AND 
 ENSURE THE FILE IS OK!* You can use the Unix diff tool to help you.
Do this before commiting the file and only commit it if it's ok!

If the file has any problems, the best thing to do is to return it to 
the translator and ask him to correct it. If you really need to edit a 
file (for whatever reason) be sure you use a multilanguage editor and 
also use de correct codepage for each language --- or you can corrupt it.
Encodings are in langlist file (msn/langlist). This file is XML-formatted 
so it must be easy to understand.

If you reject a translation by any reason, do it politely. 
Explain the reasons of why you're rejecting it and always: 
'Thanks anyway' ;)

What should I do if...
-...I receive two files of the same language? Reject one, the
oldest, or the less complete.

When you get big contributions (not just 1 or 2 sentences), or when you
notice a person is very active (sending frequent translation
updates for a language), you should add him to the CREDITS file. 
You should tell him/her about this, and ask him/her if he or she
wants to be removed (nobody wanted to be removed until now, but
it's polite to ask :))


==========================
3. For both - Useful tools
==========================

Unfotunately, we did not have time to develop dedicated tools for the
HELP, FAQ and README files. But there is a little Unix tool (present 
in almost all Unices including Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X) that can 
be of great help: the diff tool.

Use it to compare the file you've just received with the file already there.
For instance: you are atranslation manager and have reveived a new FAQpt (portuguese)
file. Save it in your system, in the msn/docs folder, as FAQpt.new. Then do a

diff FAQpt FAQpt.new

and carefully inspect the differences between the files. Once you are satisfied with 
the new file and wants to commit it, just do a 

cp FAQpt.new FAQpt
cvs commit


These are Unix commands. Windows instructions are on the way.

 CREDITS 
=========
File created by Henrique Cesar Ulbrich (Hatredman)
Based on the msn/lang/LANG-HOWTO by Alberto Diaz

Version		Created		Author					Obs
  1.0		29.Aug.2004	Henrique Cesar Ulbrich (Hatredman)	Initial file

Please don't mess with the versioning system. It's quite simple to determine
what version your mods should take. If you just add a few items or correct some,
ad one to the MINOR version number (example, 1.1 to 1.2). If you totally rewrite the file (or rewrite
large portions of it) add one to the MAJOR number and make the minor zero (example: 2.6 to 3.0).

These credits are not a reward or reconition for you, but a way
to hunt for a guilty person if something goes wrong he he he...
We have the CVS versioning anyway.
