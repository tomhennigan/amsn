tlsdowncompleted File $1 was downloaded to directory $2. You must extract it, build it (if you downloaded source code) and install it inside $3.
tlsinstallexp aMSN now uses MSNP9, which requires the use of a secure\nconnection using SSL. In order to use SSL, aMSN needs to install a module called TLS,\nwhich is missing from your system. This wizard will help you to download and\ninstall TLS. Please choose your system type so we can automatically download\nthe required TLS files.
tlsinstall TLS Module installation wizard
tlsinstcompleted TLS module installation was sucessful - you should now be able to use MSNP9. If this doesn't work, then you probably didn't select the right module, or a compiled module is not available for your system.
