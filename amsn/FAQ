Q: What is amsn?
A: Amsn is a Microsoft Messenger clone. It allows you to keep in touch with
your friends and exchange instant messages and files.

Q: What do I need to run amsn?
A: Amsn is written in tcl/tk, so you just need a working tcl/tk interpreter,
version 8.3 or later. You can get it at http://tcl.sourceforge.net. The
interpreter is available for linux, windows and macintosh.

Q: How do I create a shortcut to amsn in my desktop?
A: 1.- Add an icon to your gnome/kde desktop or menu, that 
launchs the command: 
/wherever/you/have/amsn/installed/amsn 
 for example 
 /home/yourusername/msn/amsn 
 2. Other way: 
 As root, create a link in /usr/bin to the amsn file 
 ln -s /wherever/you/have/amsn/installed/amsn amsn 
 This way, you can launch amsn by just typing 'amsn' from 
anywhere. 
 Then add an icon that launchs the command 'amsn'. 

Q: What do the magenta contacts in my contact list mean?
A: It means that you are not in that person's contact list.

Q: When I leave the amsn window in the background, and work in other windows,
after a certain time my status changes to away. Is this a bug?
A: No, it is working fine. Amsn detects key presses and mouse clicks INSIDE the
amsn or chat windows. If you work in other windows but don't use amsn, and the
auto-idle feature is enabled, your state will be changed after 5 minutes.

Q: Sometimes amsn "hangs", why?
A: When amsn hangs it's usually a problem with the sound configuration. Maybe
you're playing a sound but the sound card is blocked, and the play command
stops until the sound card is available. Try disabling sound or changing the
sound command configuration.

Q: amsn slows down or blocks every few seconds. What happens?
Q: I get this errors:
couldn't open socket: host is unreachable
    invoked from within
"::http::geturl $adv_url -timeout $adv_timeout -progress adv_progress"
    (procedure "adv_fetch" line 11)
    invoked from within
"adv_fetch"
    ("after" script...
A: Check if you have the "advertisements" option enabled, in the preferences
menu. It should be disabled as it isn't working for the moment.

Q: I try to run amsn but I get this error:
bash: ./amsn: bad interpreter: No such file or directory 
A: Hi, you need to install the tcl/tk packages, because you need  the wish
interpreter. If you think you have it, try "wish amsn" instead of "./amsn". If
this works, edit amsn and change the first line: 
 #!/usr/bin/wish 
 with the location of the wish interpreter. 
 
Q: When I run amsn i get this error:
Error in startup script: bad option "map": must be
compare, first, index, last, length, match, range,
tolower, toupper, trim, trimleft, trimright, wordend,
or wordstart
while executing
"string map $map $md5body"
(in namespace eval "::md5" script line 65)
invoked from within
"namespace eval ::md5 { ... etc
A: You're using tcl/tk older than 8.3. Update tcl/tk.

Q: After updating amsn, this is what i get when I run it:
Error in startup script: expected integer but got ""
while executing
"font create menufont -family $family -size $size
-weight normal"
(procedure "::amsn::initLook" line 5)
invoked from within
"::amsn::initLook $family $size $config(backgroundcolor)"
(file "amsn" line 2184) 
A: There have been some changes in the configuration file. A quick fix to have
the new version working is to delete the old config file in your home dir.
Delete /home/yourusername/.amsn/config and it should work now.

Q: Can't type chinese / japanese / other languages in amsn. What can I do?
A: It looks like xcin or similar programs are not supported in the current
version of tcl/tk, so amsn doesn't work with them either. You should wait for
next version of tcl/tk and hope it supports xcin. Meanwhile, you can type the
text in another editor, and copy-paste it into the chat window.

Q: I have another question, can you help me?
A: Yes, we can. But first, take a look at the sourceforge project page, located
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/amsn, and check all the bugs, support
request and general forums to check if your problem is already answered. Don't
check only the messages marked as "Open". There's a drop down list where you
can select "Closed" at the top of the messages list. Already answered question
are usually marked as Closed. If you still have a question, you can mail me at
airadier@users.sourceforge.net.
