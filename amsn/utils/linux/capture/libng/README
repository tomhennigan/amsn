WARNING: This is work-in-progress.

In the long run I plan to turn this into a v4l capture library.  But
that isn't finished yet and probably will not for some time.  Some
documentation can be found in OVERVIEW.  Complete reference is not
available.

I don't care (yet) about backward compatibility.  I neither can nor
will stop you from using the code.  But if you do don't complain if I
break your applications with incompatible changes.  You have been
warned.

Please don't distribute this code as shared library.  This is just
asking for trouble.
