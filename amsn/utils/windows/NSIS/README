This README describes the use of the NSIS installer script for aMSN.
To make the install package you need :
- A Tcl/Tk installation (below we will consider installed it in "C:\Tcl")
- The Tls package for Windows
- The TkDnd2 package with source files removed
- An export of the aMSN directory (checkout can work too but it's safer to export)
- OpenCandy SDK together with our key

Instructions :
Copy the Tls package in C:\Tcl\Lib\Tls
Copy the TkDND2 package in C:\Tcl\Lib\TkDND2.0
Copy OCSetupHlp.dll, OCSetupHlp.nsh and OpenCandy_Why_Is_This_Here.txt to utils\windows\NSIS (this directory)

Open the NSIS Compiler.

Set in defines :
WISH_PATH filled with "C:\Tcl"
VERSION with the version of your copy if you don't specify anything the version is devel
WISH_MINOR as in tcl8.x
OC_STR_SECRET as our OpenCandy secret

Compile the script

How the launcher works :
In the install package is included amsnW.exe and amsnA.exe. amsnW.exe will be installed as amsn.exe on NT like platform (from NT4 to today) amsnA.exe will be installed as amsn.exe on Win95/98/Me.

Well I think you have enough information. If something misses add it. (Hey it's GPL after all !)
