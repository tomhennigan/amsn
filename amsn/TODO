	*********************************************************
	***Bug Fixes and TODO before next release (priority 1)***
	*********************************************************

-	Make sure everything is installed correctly and FAQ and HELP are in the amsn directory.
-	Make good RPMs, for Redhat, Suse, Mandrake, etc.
-	Improve font selection (unify with color selection)
-	When selecting a new color for the font in a chat, don't change only 
	the color of the text send but the color of the text being writen too (for all window).
-	When queue is cleared, NAK every message in queue
-	Check for connection state, make sure amsn disconnects if connection goes down. -> add timeouts to changestates and keepalive
-	When we get a NAK from a message, try to enqueue it again, as probably it will success.
-	Fix focus and children things with list window. (For example add_user from chat window), and dialogs in general.
-	Add receivedir to preferences, replace NAT section with File Transfer
-	Remove old config file (we now only need the .xml, backward compatibilty is redundant since oct15th)
-	Check functionality of all proxies with new MSNP9 protocol (socks, not keep-alive http proxies)
-	Get rid of all MSNP7 code.. it sure is useless now
-	We sometimes get double pasting, just bind our paste procedure to the <<Paste>> event, instead of to <Ctrl-Key-V>
-	Phone numbers seem to be screwed up again :P getting erased for some reason


	************************************************
	***Existing Feature Improvements (priority 2)***
	************************************************

	** General issues **
-	Option to display or not the chat button bar
-	Option to enable/disable showing timestamps
-	Add option to modify keepalive interval (in seconds)
-	Add a "typed characters" counter in chat window.
-	Add an option to remove the amsn banner on contact list.
-	Make Advanced buttons in preferences (maybe a Key - Value type of list for advanced users)
-	Make a Pure PNG Reader (will be used for buddy icons + filetransfer previews, and maybe other stuff)
-	In the Privacy tab, if 2 users have exactly the same nickname in a listbox, we can control only the first user 
	(we can't delete the second user with that nick from the list ...)
-	If user blocks you directly after getting connected, doesn't automaticaly detect him
-	Improve truncation to check picture widths, instead of using fixed values
-	Load AMSN faster (load pictures on demand -> GetImage wrapper? Maybe use GetSkinFile?)
-	Get rid of all global config, make a config namespace. Only have a few global options (languages, skin, etc)
-	Get rid of global variables list_al, list_bl, make use of ::abook:: namespace (avatars, custom nicknames, etc)
-	Improve contextual menu for groups (right click menu) (we should have Delete THIS group type of entries)
-	Clean ugly GUI code (long window names xx.xx.xxx.xx, use -Class instead of repeated options all the time)

	** Remote Control issues **
-	If text sent over socket contains the color word, it disappears from the text (change the string map call)
-	make it possible to send more than one space between each words in messages

	** Dock Issues **
-	New message alert 
-	Dock is "detaching" from notification area whenever any other icon is removed from notification area

	** File Transfer issues **

-	Make Progress bar work with MSNP2P file receiving/sending

-	JPG Support (use same as for MSN6 Pictures)

	** Loging system improvements and bugs **
-	Use XML instead of custom syntax to speed up things

-	Add option for partial loging of only certain users
-	Save to LOG (if loging disabled, allows to log certain conversations only)
-	Compress log files with optimal algorithm for txt files
-	Loging syntax options (timestamps, email or nics, etc)
-	Display by day/month/year
-	Display last X lines of the log in the window when opening a chat window with someone

	** WindowsXP issues **
-	Problem with URLs
-	Problem with sound
-	Selections dont appear
-	Double Pastes on CTRL-V
-	Ugly program icons (WISH icon, not ours)
-	Fonts dialog all messed up
-	Dosen't connect if msn installed in path with spaces (ex. Documents and Settings), add quotes
-	Alarms options (paths) aren't saved correctly if they contain spaces
-	ImageMagick is never detected since there is a convert.exe program in the System32 DIR and exec looks for that one first

	** MSNP2P Stuff **
-	Do checksum checking, understand error message, send error messages, etc...
-	Get custom emoticons working (send and receive them)
