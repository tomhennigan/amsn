	***Bug Fixes and TODO before next release (priority 1)***

-	Check Makefile and amsn.spec now that HELP and FAQ files are added. 
-	Make sure everything is installed correctly and FAQ and HELP are in the amsn directory.
-	Make good RPMs, for Redhat, Suse, Mandrake, etc.
DONE	Long messages knock out remote user from chat (if > 400, separate into 400 byte long fragments and send)
DONE	New unified preferences dialog with tabs
DONE	Multiple user accounts combo box + separate user config files
-	Refinements to queuing and reconnection issues
-	Improve font selection (unify with color selection)
-	Make status change dynamic in chat window and disable input window when YOU go offline
-	Don't save password if login fails becoz of wrong username or password
-	Fix public profile, use html file for authentication and login to MSN profiles?
DONE	Notify window is only clickable on the text, should make whole window clickable
-	Add X in corner of notify window to close, maybe make it nicer too (border, etc)
-	Write procedure to redraw main window for language + font changes
-	Fix new profile issues for existing users, should ask them to add profile even if they dont go to "login as"
-	Check for connection state, make sure amsn disconnects if connection goes down.
-	Authorisation request dialogs halt all AMSN, and queue all events, then kaboom when dialog is closed, not good.
DONE	Fix use of default config for non profile logins (currently uses hard coded default config)
-	Improve enabling/disabling menu entries procedure, make language independant
DONE	When notify window is for a file transfer, clicking on it triggers a bug! 
-	Add "Make this config default profile" button in Preferences
