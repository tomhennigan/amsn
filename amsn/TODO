	*********************************************************
	***Bug Fixes and TODO before next release (priority 1)***
	*********************************************************

-	Make sure everything is installed correctly and FAQ and HELP are in the amsn directory.
-	Make good RPMs, for Redhat, Suse, Mandrake, etc.
DONE	Improve font selection (unify with color selection)
-	When selecting a new color for the font in a chat, don't change only
	the color of the text send but the color of the text being written too (for all window).
-	When queue is cleared, NAK every message in queue
-	Check for connection state, make sure amsn disconnects if connection goes down. -> add timeouts to changestates and keepalive
-	When we get a NAK from a message, try to enqueue it again, as probably it will success.
DONE	Fix focus and children things with list window. (For example add_user from chat window), and dialogs in general.
DONE	Check functionality of all proxies with new MSNP9 protocol (socks, not keep-alive http proxies)
DONE	Get rid of all MSNP7 code.. it sure is useless now
DONE	We sometimes get double pasting, just bind our paste procedure to the <<Paste>> event, instead of to <Ctrl-Key-V>

	************************************************

	** General issues **

	(we can't delete the second user with that nick from the list ...)
-	Improve truncation to check picture widths, instead of using fixed values
DONE	Load AMSN faster (load pictures on demand -> GetImage wrapper? Maybe use GetSkinFile?)
DONE	Get rid of global variables list_al, list_bl, make use of ::abook:: namespace (avatars, custom nicknames, etc)
-	Clean ugly GUI code (long window names xx.xx.xxx.xx, use -Class instead of repeated options all the time)

	** Remote Control issues **
