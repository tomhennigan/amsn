    <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#D00000;">WARNING !</h1>
    <p>
You made a typo and confused and swapped g with d in Pidgin.<br />
You have been faked by some malicious people who tried to start a war between aMSN community and Pidgin community by redirecting you to aMSN's website.
We are indeed sorry such a thing happened and the only thing we can do is to give you this smart warning and to give you the correct link to Pidgin website which is <a href="http://www.pidgin.im" target="_top">http://www.pidgin.im</a>
    </p>
    <p>
You can still visit aMSN website : <a href="http://www.amsn-project.net" target="_top">http://www.amsn-project.net</a>
