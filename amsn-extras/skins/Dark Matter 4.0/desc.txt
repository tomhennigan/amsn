Also, A Special Thanks to Montblanc for his input with the Farsight (audio/video call) buttons! Much Appreciated!!!

Thanks to the aMSN team for creating an absolutely kick ass alternative to the most popular piece o' shit messenger on the web.

I recognize some the material used in the result of this skin is creative property of other aMSN skin developers and to them i give much credit and thanks.


Tested for Windows only thus far, sorry if you have trouble with any other operating systems, but i'm clueless and probably cannot help you out, check the aMSN forums if you're having problems.
