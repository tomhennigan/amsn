    aMac Skin for amsn by Steels

    This is a skin for amsn.
	Amsn is Alvaro's Messenger, a free msn network client.
    The skin has a Apple Platinum style look
	Changes include anything changeable except the preferences icons.
	It's to retain the skins size from getting unnecesarily big.
    It was designed with great help of it's developer, Alvaro, with the
    marvelous GIMP and using images from other Mac Window themes and google
    web search.
    Included are a few emoticons adapted to apple/mac style too.
    
    INSTALL:
	Simply extract this tar file in the msn/skins directory. You should have
	two dirs, aMac and default in the skins dir, at least.
