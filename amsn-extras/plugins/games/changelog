Version 0.16:
==================
-	Sending advertisement message
	Sending message to install aMSN and Games plugin with urls in
	case opponent(s) do not seem to have this [loaded] already.
-	Can load optimized animated gifs (without using TkCximage).
	Optimized animated gifs save frames as differences with
	the previous frame, so these must be overlayed.
-	Backwards compatible to aMSN 0.95 now!
-	Several small fixes.

Version 0.15:
==================
-	New game: Hangman.
-	Each game now can have its own configuration items

Version 0.14:
==================
-	Support for long messages.
	If message are longer than the maximum allowed size, ::Games::packet_send
	can split messages up (if implemented for the particular message type).
	If it cannot split up, it logs a warning and does not send the message.
-	Drawing stops when mouse leaves canvas.
-	Violation button implemented.
	Guessers can click Violate if they find the drawer violates drawing rules
	e.g. by drawing the letters of a word. If majority of guessers click Violate,
	round is skipped and drawer is not awarded the normal points for drawing.
-	Language keys.
	Added language keys for Sketch game.
-	Small bugs.
	- Drawer also lost his 10 points (for drawing) when there were correct guesses.
	- Version conflicts in Multi-player were only checked for the last Pong message.

-	The first multi-player game: Sketch
-	Optimizations

-	Dictionary support
	Language files used for dictionaries
-	Saving images to file
	Possible to save the drawings to Encapsulated Postscript
-	Sorting players by score
	Dark green means they scored this round
-	Set required_version to 0.96
	Needed for several patches I submitted to the aMSN team,
	e.g. PostEvent PacketRecieved changed, proc pluginVersion added,
	and I changed x-clientcaps.
-	Using moveinscreen (thanks to Jerome)
	Also improved grid layout
-	Implement Skip button to skip rounds
-	Now clearing canvas between rounds
-	Decreased canvas size somewhat for people running low resolution.
-	And several things I forgot :)

Version 0.12:

	One window instead of two tk_dialog, a scale and a listbox.
	Reminds previous challenge as default challenge.
-	Nicer movelist

Version 0.11:
==================
- 	Added check for conference windows
	Message is displayed that MultiPlayerGames are not yet supported.
-	Added MultiPlayerGames to menu (disabled). 
	This is not yet supported but it will come soon.
