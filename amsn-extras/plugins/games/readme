Games plugin
=================================================================

The aim of this plugin is to provide a general framework for games.
It is not compatible with MS-MSN, however, one day someone might
for instance write a plugin for MS-MSN Plus! that would enable us
to play with MS-MSN people as well!

If you are a developer and want to add a game to this plugin,
you might want to read the developers.readme.

If you are a user enjoying this plugin, and perhaps have any
comments/suggestions/etc, please let me know.

Have fun,
JeeBee <jonne_z REMOVEatTHIS users.sourceforge.net>

Dots-and-Boxes Readme
=================================================================

Goal
=========
Your ultimate goal is to own more boxes than your opponent.
You own a box if all four moves surrounding the box have been played.
Each player plays a move (any edge that has not been played before)
in turns. However, when a player gains a box by making this move, he
immediately moves again.
If all boxes are owned by the players the game is finished.
The player that owns the most boxes wins, in case the players own an
equal number of boxes, the game is drawn (a draw is of course only
possible if there is an even total number of boxes).

Strategy
=========
You might be very surprised how much is already known about playing this game.
Unless you know about the chain fight, preemptive sacrifices, loops
and quads, it is highly unlikely you will ever beat anyone who does.
