SpellCheck

--------------------
A plugin for aMSN that adds spell checking to the chat windows via the free tool aspell (http://aspell.sourceforge.net/).
--------------------

Basics:
When you click the SpellCheck button in the chat window, aspell will parse the text, and highlight any words that are found to be incorrect. Clicking on these highlighted words will bring up a list of suggestions that will replace the incorrect word if chosen.

You can set how the incorrect words are highlighted and also the default language (aspell dictionary) in the plugin configuration for SpellCheck.

Note:
If you load the plugin while you have chat windows open, you will need to close and reopen them for SpellCheck to work. You will also need to do this if you enable or disable "Check spelling as you type" since they add bindings to the chat window when it is opened.


Features:
--Add word
If you find a word that is set as incorrect and you want to add it to the dictionary so it doesn't show up next time, click on it and select "Add word...". There is a custom dictionary for each language so if you add a word to the English one, if will still be wrong if you change the language to French for example.

--Personalised User Language
If you normally chat in English, but you talk to a few users in another language, you can set a different language for just those users. Right click (control-click on macs) on the SpellCheck button in the chat window of the user you want to change. This will bring up the list of installed dictionaries, and selecting one of these will override the dictionary selected in the plugin configuration. Now anything typed to that user will be spell checked using the new dictionary. This setting is saved so it will stay the same each time you start aMSN.

--AutoCheck before sending
When you click send, or return, SpellCheck will see if there are any errors in the text being sent. If there are, it will highlight them and stop the message being sent. If you click return or send again within 2 seconds, the message will be sent, regardless of whether you have fixed the errors or not.

--Check spelling as you type
This will check each word as you finish typing it, and highlight it if it is spelt incorrectly.

--Setting the incorrect tag
In the plugin configuration there is a list box with different options for highlighting the incorrect words. Selecting background or foreground will bring up the a colour picker, and selecting font style will bring up a list of font styles (bold, italic, etc).

--Remove Colours
This will set the highlight text to the same as your chatting text. Make sure you select at least one highlight options after you do this so that the incorrect words are visible.
