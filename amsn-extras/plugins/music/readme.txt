Hi and welcome in the Music plugin's readme.
First of all, thank you to use this plugin and I hope it will be useful.
To work with your prefered player, the plugin require some things to do.
Currently, the Music plugin supports 4 players : ITunes (Mac), WinAmp (Windows), XMMS and Amarok (Linux).

ITunes :
- you don't have anything to do it works immediately. Just go to the plugin's config to make Music plugin at your taste ;) Don't forget to set a nickname in the plugin config if you don't want to just have the song name as nickname.

WinAmp :
- you have to install ActiveWinAmp to make work the plugin.
You can grab it from http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=143299
or http://sourceforge.net/projects/activewinamp/
- Normally it works.

XMMS :
It's a little more complicated than WinAmp (just a little ;))
- you must install xmms-infopipe if it isn't. To know, go to the preferences of General plugins and see if it is.
Else, you can get it from http://www.xmms.org/plugins.php?details=212 or http://www.beastwithin.org/users/wwwwolf/code/xmms/infopipe.html.
You can also get it for your distro from the www.rpmfind.net
- once that you did it don't forget to activate it in the preferences window !

Amarok :
- I believe that you don't have anything to do. If you have Kde, it's good.
