This is an amsn (http://amsn.sourceforge.net/) plugin.
This will be (i hope) a powerful plugin that will
allow to do all you can do in messenger plus, to
provide extra functionality.

Features:
  Colour Nicks:
    Status: only deletes ·$<num> codification because
            pgBuddy only allows one colour
	    if set in the config, it colours with the last color set in the codification
  Chat Window Commands:
    Status: adding commands when implemented (now taking
            a look at msg plus commands list for ideas)
    Command list (alphabetical):
      /add user_login		add user_login to a contact list

      /unblock user_login	unblocks user_login
      /whois user_login		gives information about a contact specified by the user_login
    Mini How-To:
      Most of the commands are cummulative but this are the exceptions: addgroup, kill, leave, logout, nick, sendfile.
      So if you send /leave asdfg /logout, asdfg will be lost and logout command also.
      But if you send /clear asdfg you will clear the chat window and after you will send asdfg.
      You have to note that the first is resolved are the commands and then the text is sent
      and the commands are resolved in order.
      So if you send /color blue text /color red, you'll see text in red.
  Multiple colours in chat window:
    Mini How-To:
      You can notice that you can use the button on the chat window (at left, above the text input). If
      you click, you'll see a colour chooser, when you're done, click ok and you'll see that some text has been added, don't
      remove this text or you won't see the color. That's all!
  Multi-formatted text in chat window:
    Mini How-To:
      You can do this by the action menu in the chat window. Very easy.
  Quick Texts:
    Status: the configurator gui needs improvement
    Mini How-To:
      To enter the configurator you have to use the /qtconfig command. In the configurator you have 10 rows of 2 inputs
      for each row. The left input is the keyword and the right one is the text that will be displayed for that keyword.
      Let's see an example:
        if you have "hi" as a keyword and "hi guys!!" as a text
	if you type "/hi" in the chat window and click enter
	"/hi" will be replaced by "hi guys!!" like emotes plugin does with "/me" occurrences
      None of that quick texts can replace any existing command so check your keyword is not a command, otherwise
      you would execute the command and not the quick text.
      You can also use them by the action menu of the chat window.
  Sound commands (like quick text but with sound)
