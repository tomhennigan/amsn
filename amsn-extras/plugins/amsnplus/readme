This is an amsn (http://amsn.sourceforge.net/) plugin.
This will be (i hope) a powerful plugin that will
allow to do all you can do in messenger plus, to
provide extra functionality.

Features:
  Colour Nicks:
    Status: only deletes ·$<num> codification because
            pgBuddy only allows one colour
	    if set in the config, it colours with the last color set in the codification
  Chat Window Commands:
    Status: adding commands when implemented (now taking
            a look at msg plus commands list for ideas)
    Command list (alphabetical):
      /add user_login		add user_login to a contact list
      /all string		sends string to all conversations opened
      /addgroup groupname	add a new group of contacts
      /block user_login		block user_login
      /clear			clears the chat window
      /color rgb_color		changes text config color to rgb_color
      /config			opens the preferences window
      /delete user_login	deletes a contact from list (without confirmation)
      /deletegroup groupname	delete a group of contacts
      /font font_face		changes config font to font_face

      		color	your chat font color

      /state new_state		sets your state to new_state
      /style new_style		changes config style to new_style
      /text string		it shows string without parsing it
      /unblock user_login	unblocks user_login
      /whois user_login		gives information about a contact specified by the user_login
    Mini How-To:
      Most of the commands are cummulative but this are the exceptions: addgroup, kill, leave, logout, nick, sendfile.
      So if you send /leave asdfg /logout, asdfg will be lost and logout command also.
      But if you send /clear asdfg you will clear the chat window and after you will send asdfg.
      You have to note that the first is resolved are the commands and then the text is sent
      and the commands are resolved in order.
      So if you send /color blue text /color red, you'll see text in red.
  Multiple colours in chat window:
    Status: works perfectly
    Mini How-To:
      You can add colour to your text by predefined colors (!FC followed by a number from 0 to 15 and closed by ) f.e. (!FC3)
      or by an rgb colour format (red,green,blue) f.e. (255,000,000) is red
      You can notice that the 2nd way can be used by the button on the chat window (at left, above the text input). If
      you click, you'll see a colour chooser, when you're done, click ok and you'll see that some text has been added, don't
      remove this text or you won't see the color. That's all!
  Multi-formatted text in chat window:
    Status: works perfectly but remains some buttons to be added in the chat window
    Mini How-To:
      You can change your style of font by some text:
        (!FB) sets bold/no-bold
	(!FI) sets italic/no-italic
	(!FU) sets underline/no-underline
	(!FS) sets overstrike/no-overstrike
	(!FR) resets the style to none of them
      Try it and you'll get it in a while.
      You also can do this by the action menu in the chat window.
  Quick Texts:
    Status: the configurator gui needs improvement
    Mini How-To:
      To enter the configurator you have to use the /qtconfig command. In the configurator you have 10 rows of 2 inputs
      for each row. The left input is the keyword and the right one is the text that will be displayed for that keyword.
      Let's see an example:
        if you have "hi" as a keyword and "hi guys!!" as a text
	if you type "/hi" in the chat window and click enter
	"/hi" will be replaced by "hi guys!!" like emotes plugin does with "/me" occurrences
      None of that quick texts can replace any existing command so check your keyword is not a command, otherwise
      you would execute the command and not the quick text.
