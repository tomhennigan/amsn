This is an amsn (http://amsn.sourceforge.net/) plugin.
This will be (i hope) a powerful plugin that will
allow to do all you can do in messenger plus, to
provide extra functionality.

People working in it:
  Mark (markitus@catmail.homelinux.org)

Features:
  Colour Nicks:
    Status: only deletes ·$<num> codification because
            pgBuddy only allows one colour
  Chat Window Commands:
    Status: adding commands when implemented (now taking
            a look at msg plus commands list for ideas)

      /state new_state		sets your state to new_state
      /style new_style		changes (only) the sending style to a new_style

      /unblock user_login	unblocks user_login
      /whois user_login		gives information about a contact specified by the user_login
    Mini How-To:
      Most of the commands are cummulative but this are the exceptions: addgroup, kill, leave, logout, nick, sendfile.
      So if you send /leave asdfg /logout, asdfg will be lost and logout command also.
      But if you send /clear asdfg you will clear the chat window and after you will send asdfg.
      You have to note that the first is resolved are the commands and then the text is sent
      and the commands are resolved in order.
      So if you send /color blue text /color red, you'll see text in red.
