TEMPORARY README:

In theory, you don't need much... 
python-adns
python-openssl
maybe some other stuff...

If you launch ./amsn2.py and it gives an error, that error probably tells you which dependency you need...
You can type ./amsn2.py --help for more info... and the front ends can be selected with -f :
./amsn2.py -f efl
./amsn2.py -f gtk
for gtk, you need python-gtk... and for efl, you need the EFL, the python-efl and python-etk

If you want to install the EFL, it's easy go to http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/ and download the easy_e17.sh script :
http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/easy_e17/easy_e17.sh
Then do ./easy_e17.sh -i
It will download the CVS, automake, configure, make and make install everything into /opt/e17 (so it doesn't 'contaminate' your system).
Once done, go to ./e17_cvs/proto/python-efl and type ./buildall.sh /usr (this will build and install the python extensions into /usr/python2.X/...)
Then in amsn2 directory, go to python-etk and build that too and install it... 
Then the efl front end should become available...
